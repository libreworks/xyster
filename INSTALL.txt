INSTALLATION
------------

Xyster requires no special installation steps. Simply get
a copy of the framework and ensure that the /library directory is in
your PHP include_path.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

Xyster is built with object-oriented PHP 5 and requires
PHP 5.2.1 or later. 

Xyster requires the availability of the Zend Framework, version 1.0.1 or later.


USING THE XYSTER FRAMEWORK
--------------------

Once you have a copy of Xyster and the Zend Framework available, your
application needs to be able to access the framework classes. Though
there are several ways to achieve this, your PHP include_path needs to
contain the path to the Xyster and Zend Framework library folders.

About the PHP include_path configuration directive:

Since Xyster and Zend Framework components are rather loosely coupled,
various components may be selected for independent use as needed.
