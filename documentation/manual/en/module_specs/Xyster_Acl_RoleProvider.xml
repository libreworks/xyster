			<title>The ACL Role Provider</title>

			<para>The ACL is for determining whether a user has access to a resource. The Auth package is for identifying and authenticating users.
				What ties them together? Furthermore, what can one use to determine the parent roles of an identity? The answer is the
				Role Provider. The Role Provider is a mediator that sits between the Acl and Auth packages so neither has to know about the other.</para>

			<para>The Role Provider interface, <interface>Xyster_Acl_Role_Provider_Interface</interface>, has two methods:</para>

			<orderedlist>
				<listitem><para>getRole – Turn an identity into a Role</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>getParents – Gets the parent Roles of a Role</para></listitem>
			</orderedlist>

			<para><classname>Xyster_Acl_Role_Provider</classname> is a default implementation of this interface. Given an identity,
				it will return a <classname>Zend_Acl_Role</classname> object with the identity as the role ID. The
				<methodname>getParents</methodname> method will just return an empty array.</para>

			<para>Using this object makes it simple to authenticate a client and then add it to the ACL.</para>

			<programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
$provider = new Xyster_Acl_Role_Provider;
$identity = Zend_Auth::getInstance()->getIdentity();
$role = $provider->getRole($identity);
$acl = new Xyster_Acl;
$acl->addRole($role, $provider->getParents($role));]]></programlisting>

			<para>In this case, having the provider is a convenience more than anything. More importantly, the 
				<classname>Xyster_Controller_Plugin_Auth</classname> class uses a Role Provider to add the
				authenticated user to an ACL. See its documentation for more details.</para>
