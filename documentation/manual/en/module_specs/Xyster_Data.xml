    <para>The data package provides a standard way to manipulate and access different kinds of data.
        These classes are provided to refer to columns in sets of data, and also allow a developer to
        filter, sort, and aggregate it. Developers can construct a query or refer to sets of data without
        knowing anything about the source of the data. You should be able to sort and filter records from
        a database with the same syntax as tabular data from an XML document.</para>
