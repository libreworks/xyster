        <listitem><simpara>The <methodname>autowireByName</methodname> method, which
            will determine which dependencies a class has based on the names
            of its setter methods (these names are later looked up in the container
            when the component is created).</simpara></listitem>
        <listitem><simpara>The <methodname>autowireByType</methodname> method, which

        <listitem><simpara>The <methodname>addProvider</methodname> method, which
            takes a <classname>Xyster\Container\Provider\IProvider</classname> that
            has been configred with whatever settings you wish. This is the most
            configurable means to add components to the container.</simpara></listitem>

    <para>If no name is given to a component when added, the name given to it
